## Architecture

### MVVM

#### Model

For data model, which is decoded from server response data.

It also contains other models unrelated to View and any UI works, e.g. Error cases, API Manager.

#### View (ViewController)

For UI component, including `UICollectionViewCell`, custom `UIButton` and `UITextField`...etc.

Exclude any logic code inside it, and it's only configured by view-model.

#### ViewModel

Compared with data model, this model is for View.

It handles all logic as possible, including what to render, whether to show or hide, and API request to Flickr server.

## Third party framework

* RxSwift
(for reactive UI handling)
* Kingfisher
(for image cache mechanism)
